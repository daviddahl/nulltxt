How nulltxt works
-----------------

Think of it as a "more secure" parallel email application that encrypts all message contents in the browser chrome prior to sending. No JS crypto libraries are used at all. The nulltxt-extension ( https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/nulltxt/versions/0.1.4 ) surfaces crypto operations to JS via a "bridge API" (window.navigator.bridge.getCipherObject) which can create a keypair and return the public half, encrypt (and sign) plaintext with a public key, returning a JSON object. Decryption, reading and writing are all performed inside of a special textarea widget provided by the nulltxt-extension.

Deployment Server
-----------------

A server based on the tip of this repo is currently deployed here: https :// nulltxt  DOT se : 8080

If it is not running, or you encounter bugs, please file an issue or ping the author on irc.mozilla.org (ddahl) 

Things do not work end to end right now, there are some errors in the extension code and testing is a bit difficult to manage here - end to end. 

XXX TODO WTF
------------

nulltxt-extension: The signature is created but not verified on decrypt. P1 BUG!
  * I think it is a text-encoding issue.

nulltxt-extension: 'decrypt' does not always work. The reading widget will just close. Being debugged now.
